# Roadmaps with learning resources

Please keep in mind that these roadmaps are simplified to cater the needs of students who have no programming background and don't want to be overwhelmed by a lot of detailed and comprehensive roadmaps available on the internet. If you are a seasoned developer or someone who has already spent some time doing development in any of these stacks then please refer to WeMakeDev's official [Roadmaps Repository](https://github.com/WeMakeDevs/roadmaps/tree/main)

1. ### [Frontend Web Development Roadmap](#fe)
2. ### [Backend Web Development with Python Roadmap](#bep)
4. ### [Data Analysis in Python Roadmap](#da)
5. ### [Machine Learning in Python Roadmap](#ml)
6. ### [Deep Learning/AI in Python Roadmap](#dl)

**Important note : All the above roadmaps are created by Google Developer Student Club Islamia University of Bahawalpur, following are some repositories that you can explore to upskill yourself as a developer :**
